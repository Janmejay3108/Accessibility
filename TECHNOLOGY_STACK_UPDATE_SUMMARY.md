# Technology Stack Update Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to update the project's technology stack from MongoDB to Firebase/Firestore across all project documentation files.

## Rationale for Change
The technology stack was updated to use Firebase/Firestore instead of MongoDB for the following reasons:

1. **Project Requirements Alignment**: Firebase is explicitly mentioned in the project requirements
2. **Integrated Platform**: Firebase provides integrated authentication and database services in one platform
3. **Google OAuth Integration**: Better integration with Google OAuth (planned for the project)
4. **Real-time Capabilities**: Well-suited for dashboard/analytics features with real-time capabilities
5. **Simplified Development**: Reduces complexity by using a single platform for multiple services

## Files Updated

### 1. Project Plan.md
**Changes Made:**
- Updated Phase 1, Step 3: "Database Setup (MongoDB)" → "Database Setup (Firebase/Firestore)"
- Replaced MongoDB Atlas setup with Firebase project creation
- Changed Mongoose installation to Firebase Admin SDK installation
- Updated schema references to Firestore document structure
- Modified data storage references throughout the document
- Updated Docker compose references to include Firebase emulator

**Key Updates:**
- MongoDB → Firebase/Firestore
- Mongoose → Firebase Admin SDK
- Database schema → Firestore document structure
- MongoDB collections → Firestore collections

### 2. Project Workflow.md
**Changes Made:**
- Updated "Data Aggregation & Storage" section to reference Firebase/Firestore
- Replaced MongoDB in technology stack with Firebase/Firestore
- Added Firebase Authentication to technology stack
- Updated real-time communication to use Firebase real-time listeners
- Added Firebase Security Rules for database-level security

**Key Updates:**
- MongoDB → Firebase/Firestore with real-time capabilities
- OAuth 2.0 → Firebase Authentication with Google OAuth support
- Web Sockets → Firebase real-time listeners
- Added Firebase Security Rules

### 3. Project Description.md
**Changes Made:**
- No changes required (file didn't contain explicit database technology references)

### 4. README.md
**Changes Made:**
- Updated Backend technology stack section
- Replaced MongoDB with Firebase/Firestore
- Changed JWT authentication to Firebase Authentication
- Updated prerequisites to include Firebase account setup
- Added Firebase project setup instructions
- Modified environment variable setup instructions
- Updated development phases to reflect Firebase integration

**Key Updates:**
- MongoDB → Firebase/Firestore
- JWT → Firebase Authentication
- Added Firebase project setup steps
- Updated environment configuration instructions

### 5. .env.example
**Changes Made:**
- Replaced MongoDB connection variables with Firebase configuration
- Added comprehensive Firebase configuration variables
- Included both server-side (Admin SDK) and client-side (Web SDK) configurations
- Added Firebase service account key path configuration
- Removed JWT-specific variables (now handled by Firebase Auth)
- Removed bcrypt rounds (Firebase handles password hashing)

**Key Updates:**
- MONGODB_URI → Firebase project configuration
- JWT_SECRET → Firebase handles authentication tokens
- Added Firebase API keys, project ID, and service account configuration

## Benefits of the Updated Stack

### Technical Benefits
1. **Unified Platform**: Single platform for authentication, database, and hosting
2. **Real-time Capabilities**: Built-in real-time listeners for live dashboard updates
3. **Scalability**: Automatic scaling without infrastructure management
4. **Security**: Built-in security rules and authentication
5. **Integration**: Seamless integration with Google services and OAuth

### Development Benefits
1. **Simplified Setup**: Easier project initialization and configuration
2. **Reduced Dependencies**: Fewer third-party packages to manage
3. **Built-in Features**: Authentication, real-time updates, and security out of the box
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive Firebase documentation and community support

### Project-Specific Benefits
1. **Google OAuth**: Native support for Google authentication
2. **Dashboard Analytics**: Real-time data updates for accessibility metrics
3. **User Management**: Built-in user management and authentication flows
4. **API Integration**: Easy API key management and rate limiting

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Create Firebase project in Firebase Console
2. Enable Firestore Database and Authentication
3. Configure Firebase Authentication providers (Google OAuth)
4. Download and configure service account key
5. Install Firebase Admin SDK: `npm install firebase-admin`
6. Install Firebase client SDK for frontend: `npm install firebase`

### Development Considerations
1. Update backend models to use Firestore document structure
2. Implement Firebase Authentication middleware
3. Configure Firestore security rules
4. Set up Firebase emulator for local development
5. Update API endpoints to use Firebase Admin SDK
6. Implement real-time listeners for dashboard features

## Configuration Files to Create
1. `backend/config/firebase-admin-config.js` - Firebase Admin SDK configuration
2. `frontend/src/config/firebase-config.js` - Firebase client SDK configuration
3. `firestore.rules` - Firestore security rules
4. `firebase.json` - Firebase project configuration

This technology stack update positions the project for better scalability, easier development, and enhanced real-time capabilities while maintaining alignment with the project requirements and modern web development best practices.
